# Test_driven_development
A meal plan ingredients calculator developed using TDD

Update 1:

I want to develop an application using the principles of TDD that is to say:
1. Write a test
2. Write the minimum amount of code required to pass that test
3. Refactor that code to improve itâ€™s design and maintainability
4. Repeat this cycle with a new test (until the application is complete)
