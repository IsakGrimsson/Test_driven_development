# Test_driven_development
A meal plan ingredients calculator developed using TDD

I want to develop an application using the principles of TDD that is to say:
1. Write a test
2. Write the minimum amount of code required to pass that test
3. Refactor that code to improve itâ€™s design and maintainability
4. Repeat this cycle with a new test (until the application is complete)


# Deliverables
1. Create CSV files from manual entry on the command line
2. List all the recipes, allow the user to manually enter as many as they wish, allow the user to confirm their choice.
3. Combine the ingredients of the selected recipes into one single list, returned as a text file
4. Robust User Input Error handling
