# Test_driven_development
A meal plan ingredients calculator developed using TDD

I want to develop an application using the principles of TDD that is to say:
1. Write a test
2. Write the minimum amount of code required to pass that test
3. Refactor that code to improve it’s design and maintainability
4. Repeat this cycle with a new test (until the application is complete)


# Deliverables
1. Create CSV files from manual entry on the command line
2. Parse all CSV files into a “Database”
3. List all the recipes in the DB, allow the user to manually enter as many as they wish, allow the user to confirm their choice, (yes or no)
4. Combine the ingredients of the selected recipes into one single list, returned as a text file
5. Robust Error handling
